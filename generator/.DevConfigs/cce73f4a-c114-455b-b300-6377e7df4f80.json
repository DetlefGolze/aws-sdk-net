                "Fixes issue [#3201](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-net/issues/3201). Provides workaround for uploading nonseekable streams where the length may be set to 0. In Net7+ some nonseekable streams will have their length set to 0 rather than throwing a NotSupportedException or having their length correctly populated. This provides a workaround for those scenarios."
